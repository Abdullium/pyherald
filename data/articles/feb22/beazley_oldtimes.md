> I tell this story a lot as to why I choose not to work at Google. When I was an undergraduate and went to GHC, I gave a recruiter my CV and asked how I can do R&D there one day. She said "We don't hire from State Unis" and tossed my CV in the bin. In front of me. -- Dr Heidy Khlaaf (هايدي خلاف)


I went to a state university and apropos of nothing, <mark>the most disrespect I've ever received in my entire career was while giving a talk at Stanford</mark>.  

"I'm don't really have a question about your talk, but who the fuck are you?"

Not only was I unqualified to walk the sacred fucking grounds of Stanford, my talk was too stupid to even merit listening to.  They suddenly cut me off and everyone left before I finished.

This was c/1997. I was talking about Python+Scientific Computing. Touché motherf\*ckers.

To be fair, the topic was kinda stupid. I mean, I gave a talk on the same topic to a room of 500 empty chairs at the Supercomputing conference the year before. Bah! Python.

Also, <mark>the \*only\* time I have ever received disrespect while teaching a training course was at Google</mark>.  Kinda the same attitude to be honest.

Q: Really curious about the standing of that person that was rude to you in the python or scientific computing communities these days

I was a PhD student at that time. A nobody. Got the same respect as the restaurant wait staff I'd be

Q: ugh i am sorry.  i am not nearly as accomplished, or as ahead of the cutting edge as you were when you gave your presentation (holy moly). but my experience was the similar. the disrespect and arrogance i saw on day 1's interviews almost drove me to skip day 2.

I can't even imagine interviewing there. I was just talking. Not part of anything else. My advisor thought it would be good to network I think. Uh, sure.
