# Can Python open an **E-signature** pdf ?

Source :- [https://discuss.python.org/t/not-able-to-read-the-pdf-files/18899]

i came across this convo-thread, and there was a guy asking how to open an **E-Signature** pdf file.  
i tried using standrad python libraries like numpy, pandas.
<br/>It is not surprising to find a set of PDF files which donâ€™t work using techniques that worked for a **Basic PDF file**

but i was a little dissappointed finding out that python can't **open an E-signature pdf** not even packages like 
[Third party packages](https://pypi.org/search/?q=PDF).

as i'm an analytics fans, i don't know anything about software development/Engineering.

it would be great if someone creates a package or discovers a technique to open **E-Signature pdf **
