PEP669 for low impact monitoring is [still looking](https://discuss.python.org/t/pep-669-low-impact-monitoring-for-cpython/13018) for some last comments.

[PEP679](https://discuss.python.org/t/pep-679-allow-parentheses-in-assert-statements/13003) for allowing parentheses in assert statements seems a favourable addition with concerns about backward compatibility and notes on non-usefulness.


The [Pyston](https://github.com/pyston/pyston) project [requests](https://discuss.python.org/t/pep425-python-tag-for-pyston/13039) a [PEP425](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0425/) Python Tag after ongoing work adding it to manylinux.



PEP639 -- Improving License Clarity with Better Package Metadata is at [round 2](https://discuss.python.org/t/pep-639-round-2-improving-license-clarity-with-better-package-metadata/12622)
